# Loan_Approval_Prediction_Python
**Project Purpose:**
To demonstrate a Data analysis using Python on Loan Approval Dataset with Classification techniques. 

**Business Case:**
To create a model that accurately predicts loan approval and automates the manual approval process.
Preprocess the dataset and choosing the best parameters settings for different classifiers to get better accuracy and identify the best classifier in a principled and explainable way.Create a Separate CSv file of the predicted data.

**Goal:**
To accurately predict loan approvals after training data and applying the best classifier.

**Deliverable:**
A description of the data mining problem.
The data preprocessing and transformations
Classification techniques used and summary of the results and parameter settings in report.
The best classifier selected - the type, its performance, how it solved the problem and reasons for selecting it.
The report also includes reflection of learning the data mining processes.
